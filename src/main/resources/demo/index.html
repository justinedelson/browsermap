        The BrowserMap client-side detection library thinks your
        device type is <span id="devicegroup-description">UNIDENTIFIED??</span>,
        which is part of the <span id="devicegroup-name">NOT FOUND??</span> device group.

            BrowserMap is a JavaScript browser features detection library. It uses modular probes and code snippets that detect
            specific features of the client, which can then be grouped in a simple way to create device groups. By identifying the client type,
            BrowserMap can help optimize page rendering or it can provide the client with alternate representations of the current page.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            The following is a list of the device groups BrowserMap is capable of identifying. To override the detected device groups you can use the
            <code>device</code> <code>GET</code> request parameter. To showcase this behaviour, you can click on any device group name from below:
            <ol id="devicegroups-list"></ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            To reset the override, you need to call <a href="#" onclick="javascript:BrowserMap.removeOverride()"><code>BrowserMap.removeOverride()</code></a>.
